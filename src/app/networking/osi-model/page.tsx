                The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to describe the
                functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes
                computing functions into a universal set of rules and
                requirements in order to support interoperability between
                different products and software. The OSI model is a standard for
                understanding and developing computer-to-computer communication.

                The OSI model is a 7 layer model. Each layer has its own
                function and purpose. The layers are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical Layer</li>
                <li>Data Link Layer</li>
                <li>Network Layer</li>
                <li>Transport Layer</li>
                <li>Session Layer</li>
                <li>Presentation Layer</li>
                <li>Application Layer</li>
            </ul>
        </>
    );
